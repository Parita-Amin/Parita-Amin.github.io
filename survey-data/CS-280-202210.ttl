  survey:hasOEQ3Ans "The instructor's greater strength is that he does not only speak and teach, he also expects students to come up and discuss with him their views and he listens to us very carefully and always comes up with a better idea to make us understand more properly. Other than that he is a great tutor and I love attending his class. Thank you, professor. :)" .

  survey:hasOEQ2Ans "1. I'd like a roadmap to final exam prep - With the final coming up it is important to have a clear understanding of how we should be preparing for it. Would it be fair to say that the majority of the test will be on the textbook? Because as of right now I would be able to answer none of the practice exam questions because we haven't covered the relevant events - which has me concerned that the final - which I have to pass to pass the class - may be the same since practice exams are supposed to help you practice for the final. 2. Pacing/speaking skills/preparation could improve - I was surprised when I joined this class. Your speech was very slow and you seemed to be struggling to communicate. Since that day, every day you have gotten slightly better at speaking. I just wanted to acknowledge that this is a thing and many people were concerned about it. Several people I know dropped your class because of it both this year and previous years. I'm not sure what was causing this, but I thought you ought to know. I will also add that today your speech seemed totally normal and you were prepared and had good pacing.";

  survey:hasOEQ3Ans "You listen to people's feedback during class and seem to actually care about people. That goes a long way." .
