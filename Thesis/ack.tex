\textbf{Acknowledgements}
\end{center}

I would like to take an opportunity to thank all the people who have supported me during my research period in some or the other way.

I would like to express my soulful gratitude to my supervisor Dr. Daryl H. Hepting for his valuable time, guidance, suggestions and comments throughout the course of the research. He was always open to all my questions and queries related to my research work as well as while writing 
%DHH added "this"
this
thesis. 
He provided me with the space required to make this study as my own work, at the same time he made sure that I am leading on the right path by giving constant feedback and suggestions whenever I was lost or stuck. I would also like to thank the Department of Computer Science and Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research for their academic as well as administrative support as and when required.

Lastly, I am grateful to my parents for always being there for me regardless of the distance and time-difference between the two different parts of the world. This would have been next to impossible for me if not for them. I would like to specially thank my brother Shivam for being the family here and for encouraging and motivating me during the times I was low. My special thanks to all my friends for all their support.
