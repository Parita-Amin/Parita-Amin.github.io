We spend so much time talking about assignments that the actual lectures and discussions feel few and far between compared to the course admin days.","The website used for documentation about meeting documentation (transcripts, responses) and assignments is very nice, and I'm glad effort has gone into making it a good website.While stuttering a lot makes it a bit hard to understand what he's saying, it's not like it makes what he's saying any less interesting. I usually end up thinking about the discussion topics or the lecture topic far after the class because they're that interesting."

The freedom and encouragement of expressing your thoughts and opinions about various topics. I like the professor. Dr Daryl always keeps his calm. I have never seen him angry; I like his patience. He listens to the students, for example when we asked for extending the deadlines for blog entry assignment, he listened to us and extended it. ",This course is good. The only thing is sometimes Dr Daryl don't reply to emails.,"His calm, patience, knowledge, enthusiasm about participation. "

That, in this information society there are both risks and rewards. It depends on us how we use this. Using the internet and other software with full knowledge is quite important to earn maximum rewards. But, if we don't use it securely then it can be harmful to us and can disturb our private life. The professor is awesome as he enforces more participation from students and listens to their points and views carefully and corrects them where ever possible. Thanks for this wonderful course and a great professor. :)","If I want to change something in this course would be the appropriate syllabus for the final exam. And the other thing would be that I would be glad if this course would be in person because, for me, offline learning is more efficient than online learning. :)","The instructor's greater strength is that he does not only speak and teach, he also expects students to come up and discuss with him their views and he listens to us very carefully and always comes up with a better idea to make us understand more properly. Other than that he is a great tutor and I love attending his class. Thank you, professor. :)"
